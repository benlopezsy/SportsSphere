                <h2>The NFL has moved the Rams' wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings 350 miles away to Arizona after days of devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area</h2>
                <p>
                    The game was moved out of Los Angeles as wildfires continue to ravage Southern California. The league said in its news release it was "in the interest of public safety" to make the move.




                </p>
                <p>
                    While none of the fires are burning near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood where the teams were set to face off, the NFL made the decision due to concerns about air quality and the strain put on the community, as well as the possible demands on police and fire department personnel.


                </p>

                <p>
                    The Rams did not practice Wednesday and returned Thursday but they headed home early and cancelled post-practice media availability as a new fire had broken out in the West Hills neighbourhood of Los Angeles.
